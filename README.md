# Daily Coding Problems
Solutions to daily coding problems. Folders contain a file named problem.md that describes the problem, and python files with the solution in them. Folder naming format is YYYY-MM-DD, date being the day I received an email containing the problem from [Daily Coding Problem](https://dailycodingproblem.com)

I also decided to write these mostly in Python as a way to increase my familiarity with the language.
